# Ipl_analysis
In this project I have analysed ipl data till 2022 
The data set has 4 missing values in superover ,player of the  match,winning team columns.
It also has 51 missing value in city ,margin has 18 and method has 931 missing values
Filled all the missing value in margin by the mean of the column and the 4 values in superover ,winning team amd player of the match column wass same so deleted that.
Method has 931 missing values has so dropped that column.
